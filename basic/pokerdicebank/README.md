# PokerDiceBank

## Project Outline

In order to play games on the Radix network, a banking blueprint is needed to keep track of funds. This is specialy the case if each game round in not played on the Radix Network in order to reduce the amount
of network fee needed for gameplay. 
PokerDiceBank is such a component. This component works in combination with the game hosted on:</br></br>
<a href="https://pokerdice.kangaderoo.nl">pokerdice.kangaderoo.nl</a></br></br>

The site communicates with a back-end to support the game itself. The backend also keeps track of the balances in the component, and provides gameplay information and wallet manuscripts to the frontend for a seamless gameplay.
