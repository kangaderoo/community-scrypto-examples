# Wrapper/Bridge

-    This code example was made to find out how one dApp could have access to another dApp's method that requires a badge for System Level Authentication and a second method that requires Application Level Authentication.</br>

</br>
The following step are needed:

- The dApp needs a vault for the authentication badge containing the badge.
- The dApp needs to provide the proof when making the call to the service.

The use-case solution was a lot easier than expected.</br> It can actually be done in a single line in case of external Service Level Authentication.

        let result = self.service_vault.authorize(||component.call::<i8>("awesome_service", scrypto_args![]));

It requires two lines of code in case of external Application Level Authentication.

        let my_proof: Proof = self.service_vault.create_proof_by_amount(dec!("1"));
        let result = component.call::<i8>("second_service", scrypto_args![my_proof]);


## Getting Started
-   Source the sourceme on Linux/Bash for an easy start.

        %/> source sourceme

## <b>Wrapper dApp methods:</b>

### <b>simple_bridge</b>
This function will make a call to a external dApp method that does not require authentication.</br>
This call does require local Application Level Authentication</br>

### <b>restricted_bridge</b>
This function will make a call to a external dApp method that require system level authentication.</br>
This call does require local Application Level Authentication</br>

### <b>second_bridge</b>
This function will make a call to a external dApp method that require Application level authentication.</br>
This call does require local Application Level Authentication</br>

### <b>deposit_badge</b>
Method to deposit the badge required for access to the external dApp</br>

### <b>retreive_badge</b>
Method to retrieve the badge required for access to the external dApp</br>
This method requires Admin Badge System Level Authentication</br>
