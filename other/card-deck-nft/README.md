# CARD-DECK-NFT

This is a very basic implementation to mint an NFT with a bit more complex structure.

The idea here is to create an NFT game asset that can be used to play a standard-52 card game from within or another blueprint that will utilize its structure.

I have included some basic calls to demonstate the usage of the data field in the struct.

The code has lots of beginner friendly comments to help guide other new aspiring Scrypto devs.

This was written in **_Scrypto "v0.9.0"_**

## Features

- The main Struct **Deck** contains a field with a vector another Struct **Card**

```
pub struct Card {
    suit: Suit,
    value: u8,
}
pub struct Deck {
    #[mutable]
    pub cards: Vec<Card>,
}
```

- Human Friendly debug output display

## Usage

### **_Manual Usage_**

Run each line (one at a time) at the terminal to execute the command.
You dont have to export [some variable]=value each time.
Running each line of code will automatically save it into the variable to which you can call

```
echo $[variable name]
```

```
export xrd=resource_sim1qyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqs6d89k
resim reset
OP1=$(resim new-account)
export account=$(echo "$OP1" | sed -nr "s/Account component address: ([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/p")
PB_OP=$(resim publish .)
export package=$(echo "$PB_OP" | sed -nr "s/Success! New Package: ([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/p")
CP_OP=$(resim call-function $package NFTcards instantiate_new)
export comp=$(echo "$CP_OP" | sed -nr "s/└─ Component: ([[:alnum:]_]+)/\1/p")

MINT_OP=$(resim call-method $comp mint_deck $xrd:5 | tail -c 600)
nft=$(echo "$MINT_OP" | grep -oP ', Address: \K[^\n]*(?=, Delta: \+{#)')

resim call-method $comp shuffle_cards $nft:1
resim call-method $comp deal $nft:1 5
```

### **_Automated Usage_** using scripts

Make sure the file **_instantiate.sh_** is in the root directory.

Navigate to your root directory.

Execute this command on your bash terminal

```
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

This allows the script to be executable (absolutely necessary). Then execute the following command in your terminal.

```
./instantiate.sh
```

You can then run other methods from there.

## Callable Methods

### **Instantiates the blueprint.**

```
resim call-function [package address] NFTcards instantiate_new
```

### **Mints a new NFT and sends to your wallet**

NOTE: That this will only take in XRD as payment and mint cost of 5 XRD

```
resim call-method [component address] mint_deck [radix resource address]:5
```

```

```

### **Shuffles and display the cards**

NOTE: "[nft resource address]:1" this means that you are passing the NFT address to the component and 1 means that you are sending 1 NFT (This tripped me a lot at first when I was learning and I hope this helps you as well).

```
resim call-method [component address] shuffle_cards [nft resource address]:1
```

```

```

---

### **Deal the cards**

NOTE: Take note of the additional arguement at the end "5". This method takes an additional arguement **_N_** number of cards to DEAL to you.

```
resim call-method [component address] deal [nft resource address]:1 5
```

If you look at the log after you run the command you should see this:

```
Logs: 1
└─ [INFO ] Your hand 5 cards:  A♠️ J♥️ 3♣️ 4♠️ 8♥️
```

## Acknowledgement

By no means that is great code but I hope it helps better show and example of NFT minting as an example.

I plan on working with this more and refining it.

I apologize of having so many comments in the code.
This was meant to help people understand the code and making it easier to digest.
