# DocumentIndexer - An append-only database for document versioning

DocumentIndexer offers a non-falsifiable record of changes to digital
documents. It can be used to help auditing, to establish evidence to
be used to prove ownership etc. at a later date, or just to help
people navigate the different versions of your documents / art /
source code / etc.

Make sure you have the necessary toolchain installed, see
