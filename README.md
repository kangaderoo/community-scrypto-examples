# community-scrypto-examples
A place for the community to upload example Scrypto code.

Please fork from `main`, work out of a sub-directory of your choosing, and then open a PR when ready.  We're happy to accept pull requests of incomplete ideas that are still in progress.

Feel free to create additional top- or mid-level directories if that feels appropriate.

Don't forget to visit the [main Scrypto repository](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto) to get started!
